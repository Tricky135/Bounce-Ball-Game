# Bounce Ball Game
This project is a Bounce Ball Game similar to Bounce-Classic the mobile game.

This game was built using Macromedia Flash 8 as a part of my game development project in college. Its a simple game prototype with some fun features which can be worked on and refined to perfect it. Designing the game window, setting frames, coding the blocks and ball movement was how this was developed.
